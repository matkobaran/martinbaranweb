# 🌐 Personal Website

This is my personal website, created to showcase my skills and serve as part of my programming portfolio.

The layout was initially generated with the help of AI (Lovable AI) based on my own concept. I contributed by:

- Planning the structure and content
- Adding a new custom section
- Adjusting and refining existing sections
- Updating links and styles
- Deploying the site to my own domain

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- TypeScript (TSX)
- CSS
- Git & GitHub
- GitHub Pages (custom domain)

## 🚀 Live Site

## 📦 Project Structure

- `src/`: Main source code (components, styling, etc.)
- `public/`: Static assets and resources
- `server/`: Placeholder for potential backend functionality (not implemented)
